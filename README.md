## I-1. Project name ideas:

### Text

   - Fizz Buzz - Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

   - Check if Palindrome - Checks if the string entered by the user is a palindrome. That is that it reads the same forwards as backwards like “racecar”

   - Chat translator for Whatsapp -- can make one much better than Google translate :laughing:, yes we can talk about that but can try to provide different feature whatsapp doesnt have so it can be interesting.
   

### Algorithms

The user can add expenses, income, and recurring costs to find out how much they are saving or losing over a period of time. Optional: Allow the user to specify a date range and see the net flow of money in and out of the house budget for that time period.

  - SQL Query Analyzer - A utility application which a user can enter a query and have it run against a local database and look for ways to make it more efficient.

II-1 -Project Name: ConnectApp, FindApp etc...
II-2 Project Goal and Short Description : This application will serve as a reference to users wherever he or she is, to have access to information that he or she wants. It's a kind of pool in which everyone will have what they want.
Once we launch the site we will have the following steps:
1- First step: We will have in front of us a search bar in which we can type the thing we want to load, this bar is automatically linked to our database which will provide information quickly.
2- Second Steps: There will be categories of research such as: Education or training centers, insurance or health care, government offices, restaurant or supermarket, car wash or dyer, beauty or haircut, Phone or PC Repair, Auto or Car Repair etc. All its categories will be in the form of icons.
2- Step Three: If we choose Phone or PC Repair we will be able to reach the companies that are subscribed to our application to open an online booking or to create an Online Ticket in relation to the availability of the company in question. .
Note: After having discussed all the possibilities of scenario concerning the project, we will contact organizations and ask their opinions on that for their ideas too.
In short I wanted to give a brief idea on this project so that we can have a meeting above to discuss it.
II-3 - Platfform and Technology: Web App for a beginning and Mobile App can be the main environments.
